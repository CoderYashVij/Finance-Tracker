# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, the following scripts are available:

### `npm start`

Starts the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when changes are made.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the application for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your application is now ready to be deployed!

Refer to the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot revert!**

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, providing you full control over them. All the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them as needed. At this point, you are on your own.

You are not required to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small to medium-sized deployments, and you should not feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool would not be useful if you could not customize it when ready.
